## User Story
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Tasks
- Generate a list of questions to get user input for the different sections of the README
- Use inquirer to ask the questions of the user
- Create a README template that the user inputs could be inserted into (include anchor links to the different sections)
- Generate the license badge and links based upon user input
- Create a directory to write the file to
- Write the file
- Test the crap out of it

## Learnings
- Node is awesome, this is the first module we have completed where the subject matter actually makes sense to me intuitively
- How to utilize fs to not only generate the file, but also to generate the directory folder
- Got much more familiar with template literals and how to insert javascript and jQuery into them
- How to code the badge license thingy, that's pretty cool

## Future Improvements
- I'm honestly not sure what I could do to improve this more. It's a pretty straightforward app. Feedback or suggestions on improvements would be appreciated.
